GeoXML : parses KML/GML(like the results of WFS requests)/GPX and GeoRSS

This Google Maps Extension enables client-side parsing and viewing of a number of flavors of GeoXml, ncluding GML from WFS servers, GPX from GPS devices or log as well as KML and multiple flavors of GeoRSS,In addition to the XML it supports saving out and re-loading of KJSON (plans are in to split the KJSON parsing/loading and XML based parsing)


GeoXml now hosted at http://code.google.com/p/geoxml/
